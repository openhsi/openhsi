# Release notes

<!-- do not remove -->

## 0.1.0

### New Features

- More Updates with hardware, updated automated calibration, other tweaks. ([#13](https://github.com/openhsi/openhsi/pull/13)), thanks to [@christhechris](https://github.com/christhechris)
  - - many updates to cal code for robustness.
- tweaks to crop settings
- add more flags tfm setup
- add some plotting functions to plot raw data
- update cal file with new property for cal luminance, previously hard coded.
- fix nbs path issues from swap to notebooks in nbs folder.
- fix radiance conversion for mode 4+. The reference files were not being binned etc, this is now now done during tfm_setup. This also removes redundant work in the dn2rad function. The current structure does not work for mode 5 this way, which needs to be re thought (due to wavelength def being smaller then full array after smile correction).
