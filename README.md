version see [Contributing](contributing.html).

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+

Depending on your camera sensor, install:

- Ximea SDK (See https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Python)

## Development and Contributions

This whole software library, testing suite, documentation website, and
PyPI/conda package was developed in Jupyter Notebooks using
[nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/).

> [!NOTE]
>
> We have moved to `nbdev2` which uses Quarto to generate this
> documentation site.

### Taking a single hyperspectral datacube

The example shown here uses a *simulated* camera for testing purposes.
Replace
[`SimulatedCamera`](https://openhsi.github.io/openhsi/api/capture.html#simulatedcamera)
with the appropriate Python class for your own camera to work with real
hardware. For example, use
[`LucidCamera`](https://openhsi.github.io/openhsi/api/cameras/lucidvision.html#lucidcamera)
imported from `openhsi.cameras` inplace of
[`SimulatedCamera`](https://openhsi.github.io/openhsi/api/capture.html#simulatedcamera).

``` python
from openhsi.capture import *

with SimulatedCamera(img_path="assets/rocky_beach.png", n_lines=1024, processing_lvl = 3,
                    json_path="assets/cam_settings.json",pkl_path="assets/cam_calibration.pkl") as cam:
    cam.collect()
    fig = cam.show(plot_lib="matplotlib",robust=True)
```

The RGB representation is made using selected bands for red, green, and
blue. These bands can be customised along with options for displaying
the image without outliers affecting the colour scale/contrast. The
example flag used here is `robust` which takes the 2-98% percentile.
There is also the `hist_eq` flag which performs histogram equalisation.
If none of these flags are set, then the colour scale uses the min and
max value.

``` python
fig.opts(fig_inches=7,title="simulated hyperspectral datacube")
```

## Hardware cameras

![](assets/openhsi_cam.png "The hardware consists of a collimator tube with a slit (1) mounted in a 3D printed housing (2). A diffraction grating (3) is used to split the incoming light into its component colours to be detected on the camera sensor (4).")

The hardware consists of a collimator tube with a slit (1) mounted in a
3D printed housing (2). A diffraction grating (3) is used to split the
incoming light into its component colours to be detected on the camera
sensor (4).

We have the following implementations in `openhsi.cameras`:

- [`WebCamera`](https://openhsi.github.io/openhsi/api/cameras/cameras.html#webcamera)
- [`XimeaCamera`](https://openhsi.github.io/openhsi/api/cameras/ximea.html#ximeacamera)
- [`LucidCamera`](https://openhsi.github.io/openhsi/api/cameras/lucidvision.html#lucidcamera)
- [`FlirCamera`](https://openhsi.github.io/openhsi/api/cameras/flir.html#flircamera)

These all have the same interface so in principle, these OpenHSI cameras
can be used interchangeably as long as you have the right calibration
files.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**I’m having trouble with the software install. Do you have a guide?**

Check out our [Linux Installation
Guide](https://openhsi.github.io/openhsi/tutorial_installing_linux.html)
and [Windows Installation
Guide](https://openhsi.github.io/openhsi/tutorial_installing_windows.html).

**Where can I get a quick overview of what `openhsi` can do?**

Our [Quick Start
Guide](https://openhsi.github.io/openhsi/tutorial_camera.html) is the
best place to start. The sidebar also includes documentation for each
software module in more detail.

**The OpenHSI camera is a pushbroom sensor and requires motion to scan a
2D space. What kind of motion should I apply?**

Any motion that allows you to scan a 2D space is okay. This can be from
translating the camera is space or from applying a rotation. (or both
translation and rotation) The developers of `openhsi` has flown the
OpenHSI camera on a drone which sweeps across an area of interest in
multiple overlapping swaths. You can fly this camera on other platforms,
vehicles, etc…

**How fast should I move the camera?**

It’ll depend on what your case is. This answer assumes you want square
pixels. Assuming the cross-track (scan line) spatial resolution is 0.42
mrad in the field of view, and your altitude is 120 m, the ground sample
distance is:

GSD $\approx$ 0.00042 $\times$ 120 (using the small angle approximation)
= 5 cm

Assuming your frame rate is 98 FPS at your desired processing level, and
you want to get square pixels, you want to be flying at speed

$v$ = 98 $\times$ 0.05 = 4.9 m/s

If you fly faster/slower than this, your datacube will appear to be
stretched spatially.
